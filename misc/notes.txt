Questions:
Filter by currency? Some ETFs use a different currency in different exchanges
Other filters: how important? (currency, listings, region, sector, equity class)
Param range goes from [min_return or 0 to max_return]. A portfolio could never ever a higher return that the maximal return of its asset with the highest return right?
Where to deploy? LRZ has a service that we could maybe use

TO DO:
Add way for user to set ETFs available at his broker
Order ETFs by sharpe ratio
Prices don't seem to be correct: figure out what's going on (last price doesn't match the data) (probably leading to Nan values when allocating shares)
Update pricing data
Improve README

Back-testing TODO:
Implement system to perform back-testing
Optimize portfolio starting on x date, reoptimizing every x days, based on last x days of data
Check final value
Compare with expected results
Plot results and compare with expected results


Future:
Fix incomplete historicalData (some etfs have data that is missing a lot of days in between days with data, but this shouldn't happen because all those days actually have data)
Fix problems with deploying and simplify process. Automate deployment (how to configure .env dynammically)
Setup way for pricing data to be updated by running a script (needs mongoDB location, eikon app key and justetfurl as inputs)
Check if ETF list size can be reduced in backend so it doesn't use as much memory (or maybe write etfData to file and read it from there)
Why is the leftover value so large for large initial values?
Look at other covariance matrix algorithms - Ledoit Wolf
Add constraints: maximum weight for single asset and maximum number of assets
Check L2 regularization (check if it changes the number of ETFs in the portfolio)
Maybe need to scrape justETF to get more information(listings)
Use etfDB in the future (or get the full list of ETFs from justETF)
Add regime switching optimization


Unsolved questions:
Isn't the expense ratio already reflected in the price of the ETF?
Fix and understand "covariance matrix is non positive semidefinite" warning (Example: "IE00B99FL386", "LU2090062865", "IE00BFWFPY67", "IE00B7MXFZ59", "LU1291109616", "LU0659579063", "DE000A0D8Q23")
