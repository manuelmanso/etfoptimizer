Questions:
Fix and understand "covariance matrix is non positive semidefinite" warning (Example: "IE00B99FL386", "LU2090062865", "IE00BFWFPY67", "IE00B7MXFZ59", "LU1291109616", "LU0659579063", "DE000A0D8Q23")
Filter by currency? Some ETFs use a different currency in different exchanges
Shorting leads to near zero volatility and near infinite sharpe ratio

TO DO:
Fix incomplete historicalData (some etfs have data that is missing a lot of days in between days with data, but this shouldn't happen because all those days actually have data)
Improve exception handling for server
Improve README
Create UI to allow users to interact with the optimizer
Deploy application in GCP
Implement system to perform back-testing (optimize portfolio based on last 3 years of data, and then reoptimize every 3 months, check results)
Add another optimizer (maximum volatility, expected return, regime switching or other) and compare
Use etfDB in the future (or get the full list of ETFs from justETF)

Portfolio filter:
Add maximum weight for a single asset
Add maximum number of assets
Filter by: currency, listings, region, country, sector, equity class
Maybe need to scrape justETF to get more information(listings)

Display results:
Show ETFs by name and ISIN
Select initial value and display how many shares to buy of each
Create plot
