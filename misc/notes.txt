Questions:
Fix and understand "covariance matrix is non positive semidefinite" warning (Example: "IE00B99FL386", "LU2090062865", "IE00BFWFPY67", "IE00B7MXFZ59", "LU1291109616", "LU0659579063", "DE000A0D8Q23")
Filter by currency? Some ETFs use a different currency in different exchanges
Shorting leads to near zero volatility and therefore near infinite sharpe ratio
Running the optimization for more than ~400 ETFs can take really long (minutes). Will be a problem.

TO DO:
Figure out why EfficientRisk and EfficientReturn don't work
Create simple UI to allow users to interact with the optimizer
Improve README
Deploy application in GCP
Implement system to perform back-testing (optimize portfolio based on last 3 years of data, and then reoptimize every 3 months, check results)


Portfolio filter:
Filter by: currency, listings, region, country, sector, equity class
Maybe need to scrape justETF to get more information(listings)

Display results:
Show ETFs by name and ISIN
Select initial value and display how many shares to buy of each
Create plot

Future:
Add constraints: maximum weight for single asset and maximum number of assets
Check L2 regularization (check if it changes the number of ETFs in the portfolio)
Use etfDB in the future (or get the full list of ETFs from justETF)
Fix incomplete historicalData (some etfs have data that is missing a lot of days in between days with data, but this shouldn't happen because all those days actually have data)
Improve exception handling for server
Add regime switching optimization
