Questions:
Isn't the expense ratio already reflected in the price of the ETF?
Filter by currency? Some ETFs use a different currency in different exchanges
Other filters: how important? (currency, listings, region, sector, equity class)
Running the optimization for more than ~400 ETFs can take really long (minutes). Will be a problem.
Efficient frontier doesn't work for some filters. Throws "target_return must be a positive integer" error
Should it show an asset distribution plot?
Weight doesn't add up to 100%, strange but doesn't actually mater I think
For high initial values (>100k), leftover funds are really high
Should the download button download a zip or not really important?

TO DO:
Deploy application in GCP
Prices don't seem to be correct: figure out what's going on (last price doesn't match the data) (probably leading to Nan values when allocating shares)
Implement system to perform back-testing (optimize portfolio based on last 3 years of data, and then reoptimize every 3 months, plot results and compare with expected results)

Future:
Check if ETF list size can be reduced in backend so it doesn't use as much memory (or maybe write etfData to file and read it from there)
Why is the leftover value so large for large initial values?
Maybe need to scrape justETF to get more information(listings)
Figure out why one asset is always at the end of the efficient frontier (could be bad data)
Add way for user to set ETFs available at his broker
Improve README
Figure out why plots don't work for some filters
Look at other covariance matrix algorithms - Ledoit Wolf
Add constraints: maximum weight for single asset and maximum number of assets
Check L2 regularization (check if it changes the number of ETFs in the portfolio)
Use etfDB in the future (or get the full list of ETFs from justETF)
Fix incomplete historicalData (some etfs have data that is missing a lot of days in between days with data, but this shouldn't happen because all those days actually have data)
Add regime switching optimization


Unsolved questions:
Fix and understand "covariance matrix is non positive semidefinite" warning (Example: "IE00B99FL386", "LU2090062865", "IE00BFWFPY67", "IE00B7MXFZ59", "LU1291109616", "LU0659579063", "DE000A0D8Q23")
