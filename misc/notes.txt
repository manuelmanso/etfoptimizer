Questions:
Isn't the expense ratio already reflected in the price of the ETF?
Filter by currency? Some ETFs use a different currency in different exchanges
Running the optimization for more than ~400 ETFs can take really long (minutes). Will be a problem.
Should it show an asset distribution plot?

TO DO:
Let user set initial value and give number of shares
Allow user to download portfolio and plot
Dockerize UI https://medium.com/@adostes/using-environment-variables-in-a-react-application-ac3b6c307373
Deploy application in GCP
Implement system to perform back-testing (optimize portfolio based on last 3 years of data, and then reoptimize every 3 months, plot results and compare with expected results)


Portfolio filter:
Filter by: currency, listings, region, country, sector, equity class
Maybe need to scrape justETF to get more information(listings)

Future:
Add way for user to set ETFs available at his broker
Improve README
Figure out why plots don't work for some filters
Look at other covariance matrix algorithms - Ledoit Wolf
Add constraints: maximum weight for single asset and maximum number of assets
Check L2 regularization (check if it changes the number of ETFs in the portfolio)
Use etfDB in the future (or get the full list of ETFs from justETF)
Fix incomplete historicalData (some etfs have data that is missing a lot of days in between days with data, but this shouldn't happen because all those days actually have data)
Add regime switching optimization


Unsolved questions:
Fix and understand "covariance matrix is non positive semidefinite" warning (Example: "IE00B99FL386", "LU2090062865", "IE00BFWFPY67", "IE00B7MXFZ59", "LU1291109616", "LU0659579063", "DE000A0D8Q23")
