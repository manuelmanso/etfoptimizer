Questions:
Fix and understand "covariance matrix is non positive semidefinite" warning (Example: "IE00B99FL386", "LU2090062865", "IE00BFWFPY67", "IE00B7MXFZ59", "LU1291109616", "LU0659579063", "DE000A0D8Q23")
Filter by currency? Some ETFs use a different currency in different exchanges
Shorting leads to near zero volatility and near infinite sharpe ratio

TO DO:
Find out why prints don't show up in logs
Move code to src/ directory
Use docker to set environment variables for EIKON api key, justETFURL
Create simple README
Understand how docker volumes work for mongoDB, remove hardcoded local URL
Find out how to remote debug inside container
Improve exception handling for server
Add way to retrieve data on docker-compose up if there isn't data
Fix non-complete historicalData (some etfs have data that is missing a lot of days in between days with data, but this shouldn't happen because all those days have data normally)
Add option to calculate returns/covariance based on last 3 years (make it generic, based on the last x days of data)

Portfolio filter:
Add maximum weight for a single asset
Add maximum number of assets
Filter by: currency, listings, region, country, sector, equity class
Maybe need to scrape justETF to get more information(listings)

Display results:
Show ETFs by name and ISIN
Select initial value and display how many shares to buy of each
Create plot

What to do with results?
Perform back-testing
Add another optimizer (maximum volatility, regime switching or other) and compare
Choose maximum risk or expected return (other optimizer)

Future:
Use etfDB in the future (or get the full list of ETFs from justETF)
Create UI/backend to allow users to interact with the optimizer
Create docker for backend
