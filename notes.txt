Questions:
Fix and understand "covariance matrix is non positive semidefinite" warning (Example: "IE00B99FL386", "LU2090062865", "IE00BFWFPY67", "IE00B7MXFZ59", "LU1291109616", "LU0659579063", "DE000A0D8Q23")
Remove etfs that aren't traded anymore (maybe also remove ETFs that have less than a year(?) of returns)

TO DO:
Add some filters (cutoff, rounding, shorting, domicile country, distribution policy)
Dockerize optimizer
Fix non-complete historicalData (some etfs have data that is missing a lot of days in between days with data, but this shouldn't happen because all those days have data normally)
Add option to calculate returns/covariance based on last 3 years (make it generic)

Portfolio filter:
Add maximum weight for a single asset
Add maximum number of assets
Allow shorting (gives weird results)
Filter by: listings, region, country, sector, domicile country, currency, replication, distribution policy, equity class
Maybe need to scrape justETF to get more information(listings)

Display results:
Show ETFs by name and ISIN
Select initial value and display how many shares to buy of each
Create plot

What to do with results?
Perform back-testing
Add another optimizer (maximum volatility, regime switching or other) and compare
Choose maximum risk or expected return (other optimizer)

Future:
Use etfDB in the future (or get the full list of ETFs from justETF)
Create UI/backend to allow users to interact with the optimizer
Create docker for backend
